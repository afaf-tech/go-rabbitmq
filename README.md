# Go RabbitMQ Auto-Reconnect Project

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a RabbitMQ consumer and producer in Go with automatic reconnection capabilities.

Explores the hypothesis of using a single connection for many channels, both for producers and consumers, in a RabbitMQ setup. This architectural choice aims to optimize resource usage and improve performance in scenarios with a large number of channels.
